    Adapters are messaging endpoints.  In particular, they are the message endpoint that bridges your Spring Integration system
to external systems and services (like JMS queues, databases, mail systems, etc.).

    Adapters are an important component to every SI project. They allow the input and output
of messages to SI pipelines. There are many types of adapters. You have seen two over the
past two labs: Standard Input/Output adapters and File adapters. There are other
adapters to get/put messages to JMS messages queues, to select/insert data into relational
databases, send/receive mail messages from an SMTP mail system, etc.
